# YEGDevStories Meetup
This repo will track the issues and tasks for the YEGDevStories Meetups.

The meetups focus on sharing real world stories and experiences in software development. Hopefully we can all learn from each others mistakes instead of making our own!

Each event consists of a few presentations with a focused theme. Past themes include Large Scale Web Development, Big Data... now what?, Cloud Migrations and Synthetic Environments.

For information on the next meetup, check us out on [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/Large-Scale-Web-Development-in-Edmonton/?_cookie-check=eiBU-klbvPkmgLb9).


# When?
Our next meetup is September 13th. After that we plan to have a meetup on the second Thursday of every second month. (November 8th, January 10th, March 14th, etc.)
